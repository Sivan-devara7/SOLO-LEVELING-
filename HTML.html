                <h3> "Solo Leveling" is a popular South Korean web novel written by Chugong, later adapted into a webtoon illustrated by 
                    Jang Sung-rak (Dubu) and published by D&C Media. The story blends action, fantasy, and RPG-style elements, captivating 
                    readers with its unique premise and character development.
                                                                            </h3>
                <h2>  Setting : </h2>
                <h3>
                        The story takes place in a modern world where mysterious "Gates" began appearing about a decade ago. 
                    These Gates are portals to dungeons filled with monsters, and they pose a threat to humanity. To combat this, certain 
                    individuals awakened as "Hunters," humans with supernatural abilities tasked with clearing these dungeons. Hunters are
                     ranked from E (weakest) to S (strongest) based on their power, and their rank is considered fixed—meaning they don’t 
                     typically grow stronger over time.
                                                            </h3>
                <h1> Main Character: SUNG JIN-WOO </h1>

                <h3>The protagonist, Sung Jin-Woo, starts as an E-rank Hunter, infamously dubbed "The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind."
                     Despite his low rank, Jin-Woo continues hunting to support his family—his hospitalized mother and younger sister—barely 
                     scraping by due to his lack of strength. He’s often injured and mocked, but his determination keeps him going.</h3>

                <h2> The Turning Point </h2>
                <h3>The story kicks off when Jin-Woo joins a low-rank dungeon raid that unexpectedly turns deadly.
                     The group stumbles into a "double dungeon," a hidden, high-risk area within the Gate. Facing certain death from 
                     overwhelmingly powerful enemies, Jin-Woo sacrifices himself to buy time for his teammates to escape. As he lies dying,
                      a mysterious system—resembling a video game interface—offers him a second chance. He accepts, unknowingly becoming a "Player" 
                      in this enigmatic system.
                                                </h3>
